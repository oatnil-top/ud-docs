# Quick Start: Setting Up Your Accounts

## Your First 5 Minutes with Accounts

This guide will help you set up your financial accounts in UnderControl and start tracking your money effectively.

## Step 1: Add Your Main Accounts

Start with the accounts you use most often:

### Add Your Checking Account
1. Click **"Add Account"**
2. Name it something clear like "Chase Checking" or "Main Checking"
3. Enter your current balance
4. Keep it as a **Budget Account** (this is your spending money)
5. Click **Save**

### Add Your Savings Account
1. Click **"Add Account"** again
2. Name it "Emergency Savings" or "Primary Savings"
3. Enter the current balance
4. Choose **Off-Budget Account** if this money isn't for everyday expenses
5. Add a note like "Emergency fund - don't touch unless necessary"
6. Click **Save**

### Add Credit Cards (Optional)
1. Click **"Add Account"**
2. Name it "Chase Credit Card" or similar
3. For the balance, enter your **available credit** (not what you owe)
   - If you have a $5,000 limit and owe $1,000, enter $4,000
4. Keep as **Budget Account** (this is money you can spend)
5. Click **Save**

## Step 2: Understand Your Dashboard

After adding accounts, your dashboard will show:
- **Total Balance**: All your money combined
- **Budget Total**: Money available for spending (checking + available credit)
- **Off-Budget Total**: Money in savings/investments

## Step 3: Choose Account Types Wisely

### Use **Budget Accounts** for:
- ✅ Checking accounts
- ✅ Credit cards (available credit)
- ✅ Savings you can spend from
- ✅ Cash on hand

### Use **Off-Budget Accounts** for:
- ✅ Emergency funds
- ✅ Investment accounts
- ✅ Retirement accounts (401k, IRA)
- ✅ Loan balances (enter as negative amounts)
- ✅ Long-term savings goals

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. **Check your totals** - Does your "Budget Total" match money you can actually spend?
2. **Review off-budget** - Is money you're saving for specific goals in "Off-Budget"?
3. **Update a balance** - Try changing one account balance to see how totals update

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Put your 401k as a Budget Account (you can't spend this money)
- Enter credit card debt as a positive balance
- Mix up checking account balance with available overdraft
- Put emergency savings as Budget (unless you want to spend it)

### ✅ Do This Instead:
- Keep retirement money in Off-Budget accounts
- Enter credit debt as negative balance, or available credit as positive
- Enter only actual account balance for checking
- Put emergency funds in Off-Budget to avoid accidentally "spending" them

## Quick Reference: Account Types

| Account Type | Budget or Off-Budget? | Why? |
|--------------|----------------------|------|
| Checking | Budget | Money you can spend |
| Credit Card | Budget | Available credit you can spend |
| Emergency Savings | Off-Budget | Not for regular expenses |
| Investment Account | Off-Budget | Not for everyday spending |
| Car Loan | Off-Budget (negative) | Debt you're tracking |
| 401k | Off-Budget | Can't access easily |

## What's Next?

Once your accounts are set up:
1. **Update balances regularly** - Weekly or monthly works well
2. **Start tracking expenses** - Link expenses to the accounts you paid from
3. **Set up budgets** - Your Budget Account totals will help you budget realistically
4. **Use the privacy mode** - Turn on "blind mode" when sharing your screen

## Need Help?

- **Wrong account type?** Just click the account name and edit it
- **Made a mistake?** You can delete accounts you don't need
- **Want to see history?** Click on any account to see balance changes over time
- **Need privacy?** Toggle "blind mode" to hide dollar amounts

Your accounts are the foundation of good financial tracking in UnderControl. Take a few minutes to set them up correctly, and everything else will be much easier!
