# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What's the difference between Budget and Off-Budget accounts?

**Budget Accounts** count toward your available spending money. This includes:
- Checking accounts
- Credit cards (available credit)
- Savings you regularly spend from

**Off-Budget Accounts** are tracked separately and don't affect your budget calculations:
- Emergency funds
- Investment accounts
- Retirement accounts
- Long-term savings goals

Think of it this way: Budget accounts answer "How much can I spend?" while Off-Budget accounts answer "How much am I worth?"

### Should my emergency fund be Budget or Off-Budget?

**Off-Budget**. Emergency funds should be Off-Budget because:
- You don't want to accidentally "spend" this money in your budget
- It's not part of your regular monthly spending calculations
- You'll still see the balance, but it won't affect your available funds

### How do I handle credit cards?

For credit cards, enter your **available credit** as a positive balance in a Budget Account.

**Example**: If you have a $5,000 credit limit and currently owe $2,000, enter $3,000 as your account balance. This represents money you can still spend.

### What about loans and debts?

For loans, create an Off-Budget account with a **negative balance**:
- Car loan of $15,000 = enter -$15,000
- Student loan of $30,000 = enter -$30,000

This lets you track how much you owe without affecting your spending budget.

## Setup Questions

### I have multiple checking accounts. How should I handle them?

Create separate accounts for each one:
- "Chase Checking"
- "Wells Fargo Checking"
- "Credit Union Checking"

All can be Budget accounts if you use them for spending. If one is specifically for bills only, you might make it Off-Budget.

### Should I add my 401k or retirement accounts?

Yes, add them as **Off-Budget accounts**. While you can't spend this money day-to-day, it's valuable to track your total net worth and watch your retirement savings grow.

### My bank account shows available balance vs actual balance. Which do I use?

Use your **actual balance** (also called "current balance"). Don't include pending transactions or overdraft protection in your UnderControl balance.

### I have foreign currency accounts. How does this work?

Currently, enter the equivalent amount in your primary currency. For example, if you have â‚¬1,000 and primarily use USD, enter approximately $1,100 (depending on current exchange rates).

## Daily Use Questions

### How often should I update my account balances?

**Weekly or monthly** is usually sufficient. You don't need to update every day unless you want to. Many users update when they:
- Pay bills
- Get paid
- Check their bank accounts anyway
- Notice a big expense

### What if I forget to update balances?

No problem! UnderControl doesn't automatically sync with your bank, so it relies on you to keep it current. Just update when you remember - your history will still be valuable.

### Can I connect my bank accounts automatically?

Not currently. UnderControl requires manual balance updates. This gives you more control and privacy, but means you need to update balances yourself.

### How do I handle cash?

Create a Budget account called "Cash" or "Wallet" and update it when you get cash from ATMs or spend cash. Many users round to the nearest $20 since exact cash tracking is difficult.

## Privacy and Security

### Can other people see my account information?

No. Your accounts are completely private. Each user only sees their own accounts and data.

### What is "blind mode"?

Blind mode hides all dollar amounts on your screen. It's useful when:
- Presenting your screen in meetings
- Using the app in public
- Someone else is looking at your screen

Turn it on/off with the eye icon on your accounts page.

### Is my financial data secure?

Yes. UnderControl uses industry-standard security practices:
- All data is encrypted
- You can only see your own accounts
- No sharing between users without permission

## Troubleshooting

### My totals don't look right. What could be wrong?

Check these common issues:
1. **Credit cards**: Should show available credit, not debt owed
2. **Account types**: Emergency savings should be Off-Budget
3. **Loans**: Should be negative balances in Off-Budget accounts
4. **Old balances**: Update any accounts with old information

### I set up an account wrong. Can I change it?

Yes! Click on the account name and you can:
- Change the name
- Update the balance
- Switch between Budget and Off-Budget
- Add or edit notes
- Delete the account entirely

### I accidentally deleted an account. Can I get it back?

Unfortunately, deleted accounts can't be recovered. You'll need to re-create it with the current balance. This is why we recommend being careful with the delete button.

### The app shows money I don't actually have available.

This usually means:
1. **Investment accounts** are marked as Budget (should be Off-Budget)
2. **Emergency savings** is marked as Budget (should be Off-Budget)
3. **Credit card debt** is entered wrong (should be available credit, not debt amount)

## Advanced Usage

### Can I organize accounts into groups?

Not currently, but you can use consistent naming:
- "Bank - Checking"
- "Bank - Savings"
- "Investment - 401k"
- "Investment - Brokerage"

### How do I track multiple currencies?

For now, convert everything to your primary currency and enter the equivalent amounts. Native multi-currency support is planned for the future.

### Can I export my account data?

Account data export isn't currently available, but it's on the roadmap for future updates.

### What happens to my data if I stop using UnderControl?

Your data belongs to you. While there's no export feature yet, your account information isn't locked in - you can always manually record the balances elsewhere if needed.
