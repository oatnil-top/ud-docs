# Account Management

## What are Accounts?

Accounts in UnderControl help you track all your financial accounts in one place - from checking and savings accounts to credit cards and investments. Think of it as your financial dashboard where you can see all your money at a glance.

## Account Types

### Budget Accounts
These are accounts that count toward your available spending money:
- **Checking accounts** - Your everyday spending money
- **Primary savings** - Money you can access for expenses
- **Credit cards** - Money you can spend (shown as available credit)

### Off-Budget Accounts
These are accounts you want to track but don't affect your spending budget:
- **Investment accounts** - Stocks, bonds, retirement funds
- **Emergency savings** - Money set aside for emergencies only
- **Loans** - Debt you're tracking
- **Other savings goals** - Money earmarked for specific purposes

## What You Can Track

For each account, you can record:
- **Account name** (like "Chase Checking" or "Emergency Fund")
- **Current balance**
- **Notes** for any important details
- **Account type** (budget or off-budget)

## Main Features

### Dashboard Overview
Your accounts homepage shows:
- **Total net worth** - All your money combined
- **Available for budget** - Money you can spend from budget accounts
- **Off-budget total** - Money in investment/savings accounts
- **Visual charts** - See your money distribution at a glance
- **Privacy mode** - Hide amounts when others might see your screen

### Managing Your Accounts

#### Adding New Accounts
1. Click "Add Account"
2. Enter account name (like "Wells Fargo Checking")
3. Set the current balance
4. Choose if it's a budget or off-budget account
5. Add any notes if needed

#### Updating Accounts
You can easily:
- Change the account name
- Update the current balance
- Switch between budget and off-budget
- Add notes for context
- Delete accounts you no longer need

### Account Details
Click on any account to see:
- Current balance and account type
- History of balance changes over time
- Notes and additional details
- Related expenses (if you've linked expenses to this account)

### Balance History
UnderControl automatically tracks when you update account balances, so you can:
- See how your accounts have changed over time
- Track your financial progress
- Understand your spending patterns

## Privacy Features

### Blind Mode
When you need privacy (like when presenting your screen), you can turn on "blind mode" to hide all dollar amounts. This way you can still navigate and use the app without showing sensitive financial information.

## Security
Your account information is completely private - only you can see your accounts and balances. Each user's data is kept separate and secure.

## Tips for Success

1. **Update regularly** - Keep your account balances current for the most accurate financial picture

2. **Use meaningful names** - Instead of "Bank Account 1", use "Chase Checking" or "Emergency Savings"

3. **Choose the right type** - Put everyday spending accounts in "Budget" and long-term savings in "Off-Budget"

4. **Add notes** - Use the notes field to remember important details like "Auto-transfer $500/month" or "Wedding fund"

5. **Review regularly** - Check your accounts page weekly to stay on top of your finances

## How Accounts Work with Other Features

### With Expenses
When you record expenses, you can select which account you paid from. This helps you track spending patterns and see which accounts you use most.

### With Budgets
- **Budget accounts** count toward your available money for budgets
- **Off-budget accounts** don't affect your budget calculations

This means your investment accounts won't make your budget think you have more spending money than you actually do.

### With Reports
Your account balances and history help create reports showing your financial progress over time.

## Getting Started

1. **Add your main accounts first** - Start with checking, savings, and any credit cards
2. **Set the right account types** - Everyday accounts should be "Budget", investments should be "Off-Budget"
3. **Enter current balances** - This gives you an accurate starting point
4. **Update regularly** - Keep balances current as you use UnderControl

Once you have your accounts set up, you'll have a clear view of your complete financial picture!
