*An honest take on data privacy from an indie developer*

*Last updated: December 2025*

## An Honest Take

I'm an indie developer, not a big corporation. One of my main motivations for building UnderControl was that I wanted full control over my own sensitive data — tasks, finances, personal notes — instead of handing them to big tech companies. I built this for myself first, and now I'm sharing it with you.

I have zero interest, ability, resources, or motivation to do anything with your data. That said, I understand if you don't fully trust me — you shouldn't blindly trust anyone online. Big companies with entire security teams still get breached. So why would you trust a solo developer? You have every right to be skeptical.

## Your Choices

That's why I give you options. You don't have to use our cloud service. You can use the **Desktop App** — your data stays 100% on your device, never touches any server. Or you can **Self-Host** — run your own instance, full control, your infrastructure.

The cloud service exists for convenience, not because I want your data. If privacy is your priority, go local or self-host. No hard feelings.

## What's Saved on the Server

If you use our cloud service: account info (email, username) and the data you create — tasks, expenses, budgets, etc. I promise I won't look into your data, but you don't need to trust me.

> **Choose desktop app or self-host to fully control your data**

## Security

I do my best: HTTPS everywhere, passwords are hashed, database is secured. But I'm not a security expert. If you're handling sensitive data, self-host or use the desktop app.

For self-hosted users, security is in your hands. Keep your server updated and follow basic security practices.

## Your Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Desktop App** | 100% local, your device only |
| **Self-Host** | Your server, full control |

## Web Clipper Chrome Extension

The [Web Clipper](/docs/web-clipper) Chrome extension has additional privacy considerations:

- **Website content** is captured only when you explicitly click "Save". It is saved to your local disk or sent to your own UnderControl server. No content is sent to any third party.
- **Authentication credentials** are stored locally on your device. They are only transmitted to the server URL you configure.
- The extension does **not** use remote code. All scripts are bundled locally.
- The extension does **not** track browsing history or user activity.
