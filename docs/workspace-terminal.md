# Workspace Terminal

The Workspace Terminal is a desktop feature that opens a dedicated window for implementing tasks with a terminal-based agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, …). It provides a side-by-side view of task details and an embedded terminal, connected to a real PTY process.

## Overview

You start a **workspace session** from a task. The session runs on a **daemon** — your desktop app (Electron) registered as a daemon — which opens a new workspace window:

- **Left panel**: Task details with auto-refresh (detects note updates from the ud CLI)
- **Right panel**: xterm.js terminal running the agent with ud CLI skill context

The terminal uses `ud prompt` to inject the ud CLI skill instructions into the agent (via `--append-system-prompt`), then passes the task instruction as the user prompt. Users don't need the `/init-task` skill file installed — it works out of the box.

> This feature relies on the desktop app (Electron) running as a daemon; the web app itself does not provide a local terminal.

## Quick Start

1. On the **Workspaces** page, register this device as a daemon (the app detects your machine name and platform and connects to the backend over SSE)
2. Set a **Project Directory** in the board settings (gear icon) — optional but recommended
3. Open any task, pick an online daemon in the workspace session area, and **start a session**
4. The desktop app on that daemon opens a workspace window with the agent ready to implement the task

## How a session is launched

A workspace session is **not** a local "click a terminal icon and a window opens" action — it goes through a daemon pipeline, even when the target daemon is this same machine:

```
start a session from a task
  → backend POST /workspace/init   (the backend resolves cwd/tmux — it is the single
                                     source of truth, SST)
  → an SSE workspace_init event is pushed to the target daemon
  → the daemon (desktop app main process) calls createWorkspaceWindow + spawns the PTY
```

- **Register the device as a daemon**: after registering on the Workspaces page, the desktop app connects to the backend over SSE and waits for instructions.
- **Backend resolves cwd / tmux (SST)**: cwd, tmux session name, and the launch command are resolved by the backend and delivered with the `workspace_init` event — the daemon does **not** read board metadata locally.

## Board Configuration

Each kanban board stores workspace settings in its metadata (configure them in the board settings drawer — gear icon on the board header). The backend reads these when resolving session parameters.

### Project Directory

The working directory for workspace sessions. When set, sessions for tasks on this board start in this directory.

**Example**: Set to `/Users/me/projects/my-app` and the agent runs with that as its working directory, giving it access to your project files.

If not set, the session falls back to `~/.undercontrol/workspace` (a dedicated sandbox).

### Tmux Session

Optional. When configured, the launch command is wrapped in a named tmux session. The actual session name is `<name>-<task-slug>` (a task slug is appended so different tasks don't share a session):

```bash
tmux new-session -As <name>-<task-slug> '<agent launch command>'
```

**Behavior**:
- If the session already exists: attaches to it
- If the session doesn't exist: creates it and runs the agent
- Closing the workspace window does NOT kill the tmux session — it continues in the background
- Reopening the workspace reattaches to the running session

This is useful for long-running implementations where you want the agent session to persist even if you close the window.

## CWD Resolution

The cwd is resolved by the **backend** (single source of truth) and delivered with the `workspace_init` event. The daemon only expands `~` and applies the fallback when it's empty:

```
explicit cwd → task metadata.cwd → board metadata.projectDir
fallback: ~/.undercontrol/workspace   (a dedicated sandbox that limits the agent's access scope)
```

## Architecture

### Components

| Component | Location | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Workspaces page / session controls | Vite app | Register daemons; start a session on a task (`POST /workspace/init`) |
| Backend workspace handler | Go backend | Resolves cwd/tmux/command (SST); pushes `workspace_init` over SSE |
| `daemon-connector.js` | Electron main | Receives `workspace_init` over SSE; calls `createWorkspaceWindow` |
| `workspace-manager.js` | Electron main | Spawns the BrowserWindow + PTY per session |
| `preload/index.js` | Electron preload | Exposes `workspaceApi` (PTY I/O, window control) via contextBridge |
| Workspace page | Vite app | Split layout with xterm.js terminal |

### Data Flow

```
Start session (Vite app)
  → POST /workspace/init { task_id, daemon_id }
  → backend resolves cwd / tmux / launch command (SST)
  → SSE 'workspace_init' → target daemon (Electron main)
  → daemon-connector → workspace-manager.createWorkspaceWindow
  → BrowserWindow + PTY spawned; agent launched with the delivered command
  → PTY output → IPC → xterm.js renderer
  → User keyboard input → IPC → PTY stdin
```

### IPC Channels

| Channel | Direction | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `workspace:pty-data` | main → renderer | PTY stdout data |
| `workspace:pty-input` | renderer → main | User keyboard input |
| `workspace:pty-resize` | renderer → main | Terminal resize events |
| `workspace:pty-exit` | main → renderer | PTY process exited |
| `workspace:closed` | main → renderer | Window was closed |

### Window Management

- **One window per task** (manual sessions): starting the same task again focuses the existing window; agent-spawned sessions each get their own window
- **Position persistence**: Window bounds saved to `~/.undercontrol/workspace-positions.json`
- **Cascade positioning**: New windows are offset by 30px from the last one
- **Cleanup on close**: PTY process is killed when the window closes

## Terminal Details

### Shell Startup

The workspace spawns a login+interactive shell with an augmented environment:

- `TERM=xterm-256color` for full color support
- `COLORTERM=truecolor` for 24-bit color
- PATH extended with common tool locations (`/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, etc.)

### Command Execution

The launch command is assembled in the frontend/backend (the old main-process `buildAgentCommand` was removed) and delivered to the daemon with the `workspace_init` event. The agent is launched with the ud CLI skill context appended to its system prompt (via `ud prompt` → `--append-system-prompt`), so users don't need the `/init-task` skill file installed.

After the agent exits, the shell remains alive so you can run additional commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal shows wrong directory

**Problem**: The session starts in the sandbox (`~/.undercontrol/workspace`) instead of the project directory.

**Solution**: Check that the board has a Project Directory configured in its settings, and that the task is on that board (matched by column queries). The backend resolves the cwd from board/task metadata, so the setting must be saved before you start the session.

### node-pty errors on startup

**Problem**: Error like "NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch" in the console.

**Solution**: Run `npx electron-rebuild` in the `ud-electron-vite` directory to rebuild native modules for the current Electron version. This is needed after Electron or Node.js version changes.

### Tmux session not persisting

**Problem**: Closing the workspace window kills the agent session.

**Solution**: Make sure the **Tmux Session** field is configured in the board settings. Without it, the PTY process is killed directly when the window closes. With tmux, only the tmux client detaches — the session continues in the background.

### Window opens but terminal is blank

**Problem**: The workspace window opens but the terminal panel shows nothing.

**Solution**: This can happen if node-pty failed to load. Check the Electron main process console for `[WorkspaceManager] Failed to load node-pty` errors. Run `npx electron-rebuild` to fix native module issues.
