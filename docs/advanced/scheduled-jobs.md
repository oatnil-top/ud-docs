# Scheduled Jobs

## What are Scheduled Jobs?

Scheduled Jobs let you automate recurring work in UnderControl. Instead of manually creating the same tasks every day or week, you set up a job once and it runs automatically on your chosen schedule. You can also use AI-powered summary jobs that analyze your tasks and generate digest reports.

## Job Types

### Task Creation Jobs
Automatically create tasks on a schedule. Perfect for:
- **Daily standup notes** - A fresh task every morning for your daily log
- **Weekly reviews** - A task each week to review progress
- **Monthly reports** - Recurring reminders to prepare monthly summaries
- **Any repeating work** - Anything you do on a regular cycle

### AI Task Summary Jobs
Query your existing tasks and let AI generate a summary:
1. You define which tasks to include (using a query filter)
2. The AI analyzes those tasks and writes a summary
3. A new task is created with the AI-generated content
4. Referenced tasks are linked in the summary

This is great for automated weekly digests, project status reports, or sprint summaries.

## Creating a Scheduled Job

You have three ways to create a job:

### From a Template
Choose from four preset templates to get started quickly:
- **Daily Notes** - Creates a task every day for journaling or standups
- **Weekly Review** - Creates a weekly review task
- **Weekly AI Summary** - AI-generated task summary each week
- **Monthly Report** - Monthly reporting task

### With AI Generation
Describe what you want in plain language (like "Create a task every weekday at 9am for standup notes") and AI will generate the job configuration for you.

### Manual Configuration
Build the job from scratch:
1. Set a **name** and **description**
2. Choose the **job type** (task creation or AI summary)
3. Configure the **schedule** using presets or a custom CRON expression
4. Set your **timezone**
5. Configure the **task template** with title, description, tags, and deadline

## Scheduling

### Preset Schedules
Quick options for common patterns:
- Every day
- Every weekday (Monday through Friday)
- Every week
- Every month

### Custom CRON Expressions
For precise control, use standard 5-field CRON expressions:
- `0 9 * * MON-FRI` - Every weekday at 9:00 AM
- `0 18 * * FRI` - Every Friday at 6:00 PM
- `0 0 1 * *` - First day of every month at midnight

All schedules respect your configured timezone.

## Template Variables

Make your auto-created tasks dynamic with template variables in titles and descriptions:

| Variable | What it shows | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `{{date}}` | Current date | 2025-03-15 |
| `{{week}}` | ISO week number | 11 |
| `{{month}}` | Month name | March |
| `{{year}}` | Year | 2025 |
| `{{dow}}` | Day of week | Saturday |
| `{{ai_title}}` | AI-generated title | Weekly Summary |

**Example title**: `Standup Notes - {{date}} ({{dow}})` produces "Standup Notes - 2025-03-15 (Saturday)"

## Deadlines

Set relative deadlines for auto-created tasks:
- `+1d` - Due one day after creation
- `+7d` - Due one week after creation
- `end_of_week` - Due at the end of the current week
- `end_of_month` - Due at the end of the current month

## Managing Jobs

### Enable and Disable
Toggle jobs on and off without deleting them. A disabled job keeps its configuration and history but won't run until re-enabled.

### Run Now
Need a task created immediately? Click "Run Now" to execute any job on demand without waiting for the next scheduled time.

### Duplicate
Found a job configuration you like? Duplicate it and tweak the copy for a different use case.

### Run History
Every job execution is tracked with:
- **Status** - Success, failed, or timed out
- **Duration** - How long the job took to run
- **Results** - What was created or any error details
- **Expandable details** - Full execution information

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with templates** - The preset templates cover the most common use cases and are easy to customize
2. **Use template variables** - Dynamic titles like `Weekly Review - Week {{week}}` make it easy to identify tasks later
3. **Set reasonable deadlines** - Relative deadlines keep auto-created tasks actionable
4. **Review run history** - Check that your jobs are running successfully, especially after creating new ones
5. **Try AI summaries** - They're a great way to get automated project digests without any manual effort

## How Scheduled Jobs Work with Other Features

### With Tasks
Task creation jobs produce regular tasks that appear in your task list, kanban boards, and all other views. They work exactly like manually created tasks.

### With AI Features
AI summary jobs use the AI assistant to analyze your tasks and generate meaningful summaries, combining automation with intelligent content creation.

## Getting Started

1. **Go to Scheduled Jobs** in the navigation menu
2. **Create a job from a template** - Try "Daily Notes" to see how it works
3. **Click Run Now** to test your job immediately
4. **Check your task list** - The auto-created task appears just like any other task
5. **Customize** - Edit the job to adjust the schedule, title template, or tags to fit your workflow
