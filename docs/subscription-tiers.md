## Quick Activation

### Step 1: Get Your License

After purchasing a Pro or Max license, you'll receive an email containing:
- Your **license key** (a long string of characters)
- Activation instructions
- Support contact information

:::info What does a license key look like?
Your license key is a long string that looks similar to:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0aWVyIjoicHJvIiwiY3VzdG9tZXJfaWQiOiJjdXN0XzEyMzQ1In0...
```
Keep this key safe! You'll need it to activate your Pro/Max features.

    # ... rest of your configuration
```
