# Welcome to UnderControl

UnderControl is a self-hosted personal finance and task management app. Track your budget, log expenses, manage tasks, and organize files — all in one place, with full ownership of your data.

## What is UnderControl?

Built by an indie developer + AI, UnderControl gives you a unified workspace for managing your money and time without relying on third-party services:

- **Budget & Expense Tracking**: Create budgets, log expenses, and monitor your spending
- **Task & Issue Tracker**: A lightweight issue tracker with markdown editing, bi-directional linking, and query syntax for advanced filtering
- **AI-Driven Workflows**: Snap photos, send text or voice, and let AI log expenses or create tasks automatically. Integrates with Apple Shortcuts for one-click capture
- **Resource Management**: Upload and attach files to tasks, expenses, or notes. Store locally or on S3-compatible storage
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure — your data never leaves your control
- **Multi-Platform**: Access via web app, desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux), or CLI

## Key Features

### Budget & Expenses
Track spending across multiple accounts and categories. Export your data anytime — no vendor lock-in.

### Task Management

### AI Assistant

### Resource Management
Upload files via drag-and-drop, paste, or file selection. Attach resources to any task, expense, or note. Choose between local storage or remote S3.

### CLI Tool
