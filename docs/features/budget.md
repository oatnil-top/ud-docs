# Budget Management

## What are Budgets?

Budgets in UnderControl help you plan and track your spending over time. You set a budget amount, choose how often it recurs (weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly), and UnderControl automatically calculates your total budget and compares it against actual spending - giving you a clear picture of where your money is going.

## Main Features

### Budget Overview
Your budget list page shows all your budgets at a glance:
- **Progress bars** showing how much of each budget has been spent
- **Spent and remaining amounts** for each budget
- **Summary sidebar** with aggregated totals across all budgets
- **Search** to quickly find specific budgets
- **Privacy mode** to hide amounts when sharing your screen

### Creating a Budget
1. Click "Add Budget" to open the creation form
2. Enter a name (like "Groceries" or "Marketing Q1")
3. Set the initial amount
4. Choose a frequency - weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly
5. Pick a start date
6. Your budget is ready to track

## Budget Plans

A budget plan defines how much money is allocated and how often. You can have multiple plans on a single budget to reflect changes over time.

- **Weekly** - Budget resets each week
- **Monthly** - Budget resets each month
- **Quarterly** - Budget resets every three months
- **Yearly** - Annual budget allocation

### Changing Your Budget
Need to adjust your budget mid-period? Add a new plan with the updated amount. UnderControl handles the transition automatically, so your totals stay accurate even when allocations change.

## One-Time Adjustments

Sometimes you need to add or subtract money outside the regular plan:
- **Bonus** - Got extra budget approved? Add a positive adjustment
- **Refund** - Received money back? Add it as an adjustment
- **Correction** - Made an error? Fix it with an adjustment

Each adjustment includes an amount, date, and optional reason for your records.

## How Budget Totals Work

UnderControl dynamically calculates your total budget based on:

1. **Initial amount** - Your starting balance
2. **Plan allocations** - Recurring amounts multiplied by the number of periods elapsed
3. **One-time adjustments** - Manual additions or deductions up to today's date

This means your budget total grows automatically as time passes, giving you a realistic view of your available funds.

## Budget Detail Page

Click on any budget to see its full details:

- **Hero section** - Budget name, total amount, spent amount, and remaining balance with a visual progress indicator
- **Spending trend chart** - An area chart comparing your actual spending against the budget line over 7, 30, or 90 days
- **Expense ledger** - All expenses linked to this budget, searchable and filterable by date
- **Budget inspector** - A sidebar showing metadata, plan details, and visibility status

## Managing Budgets

### Hiding Budgets
Don't want to see a budget on your main list? Hide it instead of deleting it. Hidden budgets keep their data and can be shown again anytime using the "Show hidden" toggle.

### Deleting Budgets
Deleting a budget permanently removes it. Any expenses linked to the budget remain in your system - they just won't be associated with a budget anymore.

### View Modes
Switch between **Monthly view** for a period-by-period breakdown and **Detailed view** for a comprehensive look at plans and adjustments.

## Privacy Features

### Blind Mode
Toggle blind mode to hide all monetary amounts. This is perfect for screen sharing or presentations where you need to demonstrate the app without revealing financial details.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with your biggest categories** - Create budgets for your largest spending areas first (rent, groceries, entertainment)
2. **Use meaningful names** - "March Marketing Campaign" is more useful than "Budget 3"
3. **Review the spending chart** - The trend chart quickly shows if you're on track or overspending
4. **Add reasons to adjustments** - Future you will appreciate knowing why you adjusted a budget
5. **Link expenses consistently** - The budget vs. actual comparison only works when expenses are linked to budgets

## How Budgets Work with Other Features

### With Expenses
When you create an expense, you can link it to a budget. The expense amount counts toward that budget's "spent" total, and it appears in the budget's expense ledger.

### With Accounts
Budget accounts in your account list count toward your available spending money, giving you a complete picture of what you can afford to budget.

### With Collaboration
Share budgets with other users through the collaboration system. Shared budgets let team members or family members track spending together.

## Getting Started

1. **Create your first budget** - Start with a monthly budget for your most common expense category
2. **Link your expenses** - When adding expenses, select the appropriate budget
3. **Check the trend chart** - After a week or two, review your spending trend to see how you're tracking
4. **Adjust as needed** - Add new plans or one-time adjustments to keep your budget realistic
