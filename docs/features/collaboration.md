# Collaboration

## What is Collaboration?

Collaboration in UnderControl lets you work together with others by creating groups, sharing tasks, and managing permissions. Whether you're coordinating with a team at work or sharing finances with a partner, groups keep everyone on the same page.

## Main Features

### Groups
Groups are shared workspaces where members can access shared items:
- **Create a group** with a name and description
- **Invite members** using shareable invite links
- **Manage roles** - Group admins have full control, members can view shared resources

### Sharing Tasks
Share individual tasks with your group members:
- **Read-only sharing** - Members can view the task but not edit it
- **Read-write sharing** - Members can view and edit the task
- Shared tasks appear in group members' task lists
- Attached resources (files, images) are accessible to group members

### Invitation Links
Invite people to your group with shareable links:
- **Generate a link** that anyone can use to join
- **Set expiration** - Links can expire after a set time for security
- **Revoke links** - Disable an invite link at any time
- **Track usage** - See which invites have been used

## Group Roles

| Role | What They Can Do |
|------|-----------------|
| **Owner** | Full control - manage members, settings, invites, and all shared content |
| **Admin** | Manage members and invites, access all shared content |
| **Member** | View and interact with shared resources based on permissions |

## How to Use Groups

### Creating a Group
1. Go to the **Groups** page
2. Click **Create Group**
3. Enter a group name (e.g., "Family Budget" or "Project Team")
4. Add an optional description
5. Your group is ready - you're automatically the owner

### Inviting Members
1. Open your group
2. Click **Create Invite**
3. Optionally set an expiration date
4. Copy the invite link and share it with the person you want to invite
5. They click the link, log in (or register), and join your group

### Sharing a Task
1. Open the task you want to share
2. Select your group and permission level (read or read-write)
3. The task is now visible to all group members

### Managing Members
Group admins can:
- View all members with their roles and join dates
- Remove members from the group
- View and revoke invite links

## Permission System

UnderControl uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage what users can do:

### System Roles
- **Admin** - Full system access including admin panel
- **User** - Standard access to all core features
- **Visitor** - Limited access for temporary users

### Custom Roles
Administrators can create custom roles with specific permission sets tailored to your organization's needs. Permissions cover tasks, expenses, budgets, accounts, files, and advanced features.

## Tips for Success

1. **Use descriptive group names** - "Q1 Marketing Team" is better than "Group 1"

2. **Set invite expiration** - For security, set expiration dates on invite links rather than leaving them active indefinitely

3. **Choose the right permission level** - Use read-only sharing when members just need to see a task, read-write when they need to collaborate on it

4. **Review members regularly** - Remove members who no longer need access to keep your group clean

5. **One group at a time** - Each user can belong to one group currently, so choose your group membership carefully

## How Collaboration Works with Other Features

### With Tasks
Share tasks with read or read-write permissions. Group members see shared tasks in their task lists and can interact based on their permission level.

### With Kanban Boards
Shared kanban boards automatically create groups. The board creator becomes the group admin, and board collaborators join as members.

### With Resources
Files attached to shared tasks are automatically accessible to group members. No need to share files separately.

### With Budgets
Budget sharing integrates with the group system, allowing members to view or collaborate on shared budgets.

## Getting Started

1. **Create your first group** - Go to Groups and set up a workspace
2. **Invite a member** - Generate an invite link and share it
3. **Share a task** - Pick a task and share it with your group
4. **Explore permissions** - Try both read-only and read-write sharing to see what works best
