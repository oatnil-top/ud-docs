# Expense Tracking

## What is Expense Tracking?

Expense Tracking in UnderControl lets you record and analyze your spending. You can add expenses manually, snap a photo of a receipt and let AI extract the details, or simply type what you spent in plain language. Every expense can be linked to a budget and payment account, giving you a complete picture of where your money goes.

## Three Ways to Add Expenses

### 1. Manual Entry
The traditional way - fill out a form with:
- **Amount** with a built-in calculator for quick math
- **Currency** selection
- **Title** and **description**
- **Budget** to link the expense to
- **Payment account** used for the purchase
- **Date** the expense occurred

### 2. AI Receipt Scanning
Let AI do the work for you:
1. Upload a receipt image by dragging it in, pasting with Ctrl+V, or using the file picker
2. You can upload multiple receipts at once for batch processing
3. AI analyzes the image and extracts the amount, title, vendor, date, and category
4. The expense is created automatically and linked to the receipt image

Receipt processing happens in the background - you can continue using the app while the AI works.

### 3. Text-to-Expense
Just describe what you spent in plain language:
- Type something like "Lunch at Starbucks $15.50" or "Grocery shopping 45 dollars"
- AI instantly parses it into a structured expense
- The system uses your existing budgets as context to suggest the right category

## Managing Expenses

### Expense List
Your expenses page shows:
- **All expenses** in a searchable, filterable list
- **Date range filter** to focus on a specific period
- **Title search** to find specific expenses
- **Summary section** with total count and amount
- **List and table views** for different preferences

### Expense Details
Click any expense to see its full details:
- **Amount** displayed prominently
- **Source receipt** preview (if created via AI scanning)
- **Editable description** and metadata
- **Attachment management** for adding supporting documents
- **Creation and update timestamps**

### Hiding and Deleting
- **Hide** an expense to remove it from your default list without losing the data - you can unhide it anytime
- **Delete** permanently removes the expense

## File Attachments

Attach receipt images, invoices, or any supporting documents to your expenses. This is especially useful for:
- Keeping receipts for warranty claims
- Documenting business expenses for reimbursement
- Maintaining records for tax purposes

## Privacy Features

### Blind Mode
Toggle blind mode to hide all monetary amounts across your expense list. Perfect for when you're sharing your screen or demonstrating the app.

## Tips for Success

1. **Try AI receipt scanning** - It's the fastest way to add expenses and keeps a copy of your receipt automatically
2. **Link expenses to budgets** - This is what makes budget tracking work, so always select the right budget when adding an expense
3. **Use the date field correctly** - Set the occurrence date to when you actually spent the money, not when you're entering it
4. **Add descriptions** - A short note about what the expense was for helps when reviewing spending later
5. **Batch your receipts** - Upload multiple receipt images at once to process a stack of receipts quickly

## How Expenses Work with Other Features

### With Budgets
When you link an expense to a budget, it counts toward that budget's "spent" total. The budget detail page shows all associated expenses, and the spending trend chart reflects your actual spending against the budget line.

### With Accounts
Select which payment account you used for each expense. This helps you understand spending patterns across different accounts - like how much goes on your credit card vs. checking account.

### With Resources
Receipt images are stored as resources in UnderControl. AI-scanned receipts are automatically linked to the expense, so you always have the original receipt attached.

### With AI Features
The AI assistant can:
- Extract expense details from receipt images (amount, vendor, date, category)
- Parse natural language text into structured expenses
- Use your budget list as context to suggest the right budget for each expense

## Getting Started

1. **Add your first expense** - Try the manual form or snap a photo of a recent receipt
2. **Link it to a budget** - Select the budget this expense belongs to
3. **Explore AI features** - Upload a receipt image or type a quick description to see AI-powered expense creation in action
4. **Review your spending** - Use the date filter and search to analyze your expenses over time
