# Query Syntax

UnderControl provides a powerful SQL-like query syntax for filtering and searching tasks. You can write queries manually or let AI generate them from natural language.

## Where Queries Are Used

The query syntax is available across the entire application:

- **Advanced Search** — Build complex filter conditions on the search page
- **Custom Views** — Define a Root Query for views to filter which tasks are displayed
- **Kanban Filtering** — Filter tasks within kanban board columns
- **Saved Queries** — Save frequently used queries for one-click access
- **CLI** — Run queries from the terminal with `ud task query`
- **AI Chat** — Describe what you want in natural language and let AI generate the query

:::tip Don't want to write queries manually?
Use the **AI Chat** feature on the task page — just describe what you're looking for in plain language, and the AI will generate the query for you. This works in both the web UI and the CLI (`ud task nlquery`).
:::

---

## Quick Start

Here are a few queries to get you started:

```sql
-- Find all todo tasks
status = 'todo'

-- Find overdue tasks
deadline < 'today' AND status != 'done'

-- Search tasks by title
title ILIKE '%meeting%'

-- Tasks created in the last week, sorted by newest first
created_at >= '-7d' ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

---

## Available Fields

### Built-in Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | Text | Task title |
| `description` | Text | Task description |
| `status` | Text | Task status: `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`, `archived` |
| `tags` | Array | List of tags attached to the task |
| `deadline` | Datetime | Due date |
| `created_at` | Datetime | When the task was created |
| `updated_at` | Datetime | When the task was last modified |

### Custom Fields

Custom fields are queried using the `cf.` prefix. The prefix is followed by the custom field's name (slug).

```sql
cf.priority = 5
cf.priority > 3
cf.priority IN (1, 2, 3)
cf.department = 'engineering'
```

#### Custom Field Types

Each custom field type supports a specific set of operators:

| Type | Description | Supported Operators |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Number (`number`) | Numeric values | `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` |
| Text (`text`) | Text values | `=`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` |
| Select (`select`) | Dropdown selection | `=`, `!=`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` |
| Checkbox (`checkbox`) | Boolean value | `=`, `!=`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` |
| User (`user`) | User reference | `=`, `!=`, `IN`, `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` |

:::info Custom Field Names
Custom field names are the slugs you defined when creating the field. For example, if you created a field called "Priority Level", the slug might be `priority_level`, and you would query it as `cf.priority_level`.
:::

## Operators

### Comparison Operators

#### Equality and Inequality

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `=` | Equal to | `status = 'todo'` |
| `!=` | Not equal to | `status != 'archived'` |

#### Numeric and Date Comparisons

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `>` | Greater than | `deadline > 'today'` |
| `<` | Less than | `deadline < 'today'` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal | `created_at >= '-7d'` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal | `deadline <= 'tomorrow'` |

These operators work with datetime fields, numeric custom fields, and standard date values.

#### Null Checks

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `IS NULL` | Field has no value set | `deadline IS NULL` |
| `IS NOT NULL` | Field has a value set | `deadline IS NOT NULL` |

Use null checks to find tasks where optional fields (like deadline or custom fields) are empty or filled in.

### Text Search Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LIKE` | Pattern matching (case-sensitive) | `title LIKE '%Bug%'` |
| `ILIKE` | Pattern matching (case-insensitive) | `title ILIKE '%bug%'` |

Use the `%` wildcard to match any sequence of characters:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `'%meeting%'` | Contains "meeting" anywhere |
| `'meeting%'` | Starts with "meeting" |
| `'%meeting'` | Ends with "meeting" |

:::tip
`ILIKE` is usually the better choice for text search since it's case-insensitive. Use `LIKE` only when you specifically need case-sensitive matching.
:::

### Multi-Value Operators

#### IN

Check if a field value is in a given list:

```sql
status IN ('todo', 'in-progress')
cf.department IN ('engineering', 'design', 'marketing')
```

#### CONTAINS_ALL (Array Fields)

Check if an array field contains **all** specified values. This is primarily used with the `tags` field:

```sql
-- Tasks that have BOTH the 'work' AND 'urgent' tags
tags CONTAINS_ALL ('work', 'urgent')
```

#### BETWEEN

Check if a value falls within a range (inclusive):

```sql
deadline BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
created_at BETWEEN '-7d' AND 'today'
cf.estimate BETWEEN 5 AND 20
```

---

## Datetime Expressions

Datetime fields (`deadline`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) accept several convenient date expression formats in addition to standard ISO 8601 dates (e.g., `2024-01-15`).

### Named Expressions

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `today` | Start of today (midnight) |
| `yesterday` | Start of yesterday |
| `tomorrow` | Start of tomorrow |
| `now` | Current exact time (date + time) |

### Relative Expressions

Relative expressions let you specify a point in time relative to now. Use `-` for the past and `+` for the future:

| Format | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-Nd` or `-Ndays` | N days ago | `-7d` = 7 days ago |
| `+Nd` or `+Ndays` | N days from now | `+3d` = 3 days from now |
| `-Nw` or `-Nweeks` | N weeks ago | `-2w` = 2 weeks ago |
| `+Nw` or `+Nweeks` | N weeks from now | `+1w` = 1 week from now |
| `-Nm` or `-Nmonths` | N months ago | `-1m` = 1 month ago |
| `+Nm` or `+Nmonths` | N months from now | `+3m` = 3 months from now |
| `-Ny` or `-Nyears` | N years ago | `-1y` = 1 year ago |

### Datetime Examples

```sql
-- Tasks due today or earlier
deadline <= 'today'

-- Tasks created in the last 7 days
created_at >= '-7d'

-- Tasks updated this week
updated_at >= '-1w' AND updated_at <= 'today'

-- Tasks due within the next week
deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+7d'

-- Tasks due within the next month
deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+1m'

-- Tasks created in a specific year
created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
```

:::info Standard Date Formats
You can also use standard ISO 8601 date formats like `2024-01-15` or `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`. These are useful when you need to query for a specific fixed date rather than a relative one.

## Logical Operators

### AND and OR

Combine multiple conditions with `AND` and `OR`:

```sql
-- Both conditions must be true
status = 'todo' AND deadline <= 'today'

-- Either condition can be true
status = 'done' OR status = 'archived'
```

### Operator Precedence

`AND` has **higher precedence** than `OR`. This means `AND` conditions are evaluated first.

The following query:

```sql
status = 'todo' OR pinned = 'true' AND deadline <= 'today'
```

Is evaluated as:

```sql
status = 'todo' OR (pinned = 'true' AND deadline <= 'today')
```

### Using Parentheses

Use parentheses to explicitly control evaluation order:

```sql
-- Tasks that are either todo or in-progress, AND are due today
(status = 'todo' OR status = 'in-progress') AND deadline <= 'today'

-- Tasks that are either due today or tagged urgent, AND not done
(deadline <= 'today' OR tags = 'urgent') AND status != 'done'

-- Nested grouping
(status = 'todo' AND deadline <= 'today') OR (status = 'in-progress' AND tags = 'urgent')
```

:::tip
When combining `AND` and `OR` in the same query, always use parentheses to make your intent clear — even when they're not strictly necessary. This makes queries easier to read and avoids unexpected results from precedence rules.
:::

---

## ORDER BY

Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort query results. It's always placed at the end of the query.

```sql
-- Sort all results by creation time (newest first)
ORDER BY created_at DESC

-- Filter and sort
status = 'todo' ORDER BY created_at DESC

-- Overdue tasks sorted by deadline (earliest first)
deadline < 'today' AND status != 'done' ORDER BY deadline ASC
```

### Sortable Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `created_at` | Sort by creation time |
| `updated_at` | Sort by last update time |
| `deadline` | Sort by due date |
| `title` | Sort alphabetically by title |

### Sort Direction

| Direction | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ASC` | Ascending — smallest to largest, earliest to latest, A to Z |
| `DESC` | Descending — largest to smallest, latest to earliest, Z to A |

If no direction is specified, the default is `DESC`.

## Saved Queries

Saved Queries let you store frequently used queries for quick access. Instead of typing the same query every time, you can save it with a name and execute it with one click.

### Features

- **Create** — Save any query with a descriptive name
- **Execute** — Run a saved query and see matching tasks inline
- **Edit** — Update the name or query string of a saved query
- **Pin** — Pin important queries to the top of the list for quick access
- **Reorder** — Drag and drop to organize your saved queries
- **Delete** — Remove queries you no longer need

### How to Use Saved Queries

1. Navigate to the **Saved Queries** page from the sidebar
2. Click **New Query** to create a saved query
3. Give it a name (e.g., "My Overdue Tasks") and enter the query string
4. Click on a saved query to expand it and see matching results
5. Pin frequently used queries to keep them at the top

### Example Saved Queries

| Name | Query |
|------|-------|
| Overdue Tasks | `deadline < 'today' AND status != 'done' AND status != 'archived'` |
| Due This Week | `deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+7d' AND status != 'done'` |
| Recently Active | `updated_at >= '-7d' AND status IN ('todo', 'in-progress')` |
| Urgent Items | `(deadline <= 'today' OR tags = 'urgent') AND status != 'done'` |
| Unplanned Tasks | `deadline IS NULL AND status = 'todo'` |

## Using Queries in the CLI

The UnderControl CLI supports running queries directly from the terminal. This is useful for scripting, automation, and quick lookups without leaving your terminal workflow.

### `ud task query`

Run a structured query using the same syntax documented above:

```bash
ud task query "<query>" [flags]
```

**Flags:**
- `--page` — Page number (default: 1)
- `--limit` — Items per page (default: 50)
- `--sort` — Sort field (`title`, `deadline`, `created_at`, `updated_at`)
- `--order` — Sort direction (`asc`, `desc`)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Find all todo tasks
ud task query "status = 'todo'"

# Search by title
ud task query "title ILIKE '%api%'"

# Tasks due this week
ud task query "deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+7d'"

# Tagged tasks
ud task query "tags = 'urgent'"

# Complex query with sorting
ud task query "(status = 'todo' OR status = 'in-progress') AND deadline <= 'today'" --sort deadline --order asc

# Paginated results
ud task query "status != 'archived'" --page 2 --limit 20
```

### `ud task nlquery`

Query tasks using natural language — the AI translates your request into a structured query:

```bash
ud task nlquery "<natural language>"
ud task nl "<natural language>"  # Short alias
```

**Examples:**

```bash
ud task nlquery "show me overdue tasks"
ud task nlquery "tasks tagged with work that are not done"
ud task nlquery "find tasks with report in the title"
ud task nlquery "tasks created in the last week"
ud task nlquery "high priority items due this month"
```

:::info
The natural language query feature requires an AI provider to be configured. The AI interprets your request and generates the corresponding structured query, then executes it.
:::

For full CLI documentation, see the [CLI Reference](./cli).

---

## AI-Powered Queries

UnderControl integrates AI to make querying more accessible. Instead of learning the query syntax, you can describe what you want in plain language.

### In the Web UI

1. Open the task page
2. Open the **AI Chat** panel
3. Type your request in natural language, for example:
   - "Show me tasks that are overdue"
   - "Find all tasks tagged with 'work' that are due this week"
   - "What tasks were updated today?"
4. The AI generates and executes the structured query

### In the CLI

Use `ud task nlquery` (or its alias `ud task nl`):

```bash
ud task nlquery "tasks I need to do this week"
```

The AI understands context and intent, so you can use conversational language. It translates your request into the structured query syntax and returns matching tasks.

## Practical Examples

### By Status

```sql
-- All todo tasks
status = 'todo'

-- In-progress tasks
status = 'in-progress'

-- Completed tasks
status = 'done'

-- All incomplete tasks (todo or in-progress)
status IN ('todo', 'in-progress')

-- Non-archived tasks
status != 'archived'
```

### By Deadline

```sql
-- Tasks due today or earlier (not yet done)
deadline <= 'today' AND status != 'done' AND status != 'archived'

-- Overdue tasks
deadline < 'today' AND status != 'done' AND status != 'archived'

-- Due this week
deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+7d' AND status != 'done'

-- Due this month
deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+30d' AND status != 'done'

-- No deadline set
deadline IS NULL

-- Has a deadline
deadline IS NOT NULL

-- Tasks without a deadline that are still todo
deadline IS NULL AND status = 'todo'
```

### By Time

```sql
-- Created in the last 7 days
created_at >= '-7d'

-- Updated in the last 7 days
updated_at >= '-7d'

-- Created this month
created_at >= '-30d'

-- Updated today
updated_at >= 'today'

-- Created in a specific date range
created_at BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-30'
```

### By Tags

```sql
-- Tasks with a specific tag
tags = 'work'

-- Tasks with any of several tags
tags IN ('work', 'personal')

-- Tasks with ALL specified tags
tags CONTAINS_ALL ('work', 'urgent')
```

### Text Search

```sql
-- Title contains a keyword (case-insensitive)
title ILIKE '%meeting%'

-- Description contains a keyword
description ILIKE '%important%'

-- Title starts with a specific word
title ILIKE 'bug%'

-- Case-sensitive title search
title LIKE '%API%'
```

### Custom Fields

```sql
-- Numeric custom field comparisons
cf.priority > 5
cf.estimate >= 10
cf.priority BETWEEN 1 AND 3

-- Text/select custom field
cf.department = 'engineering'
cf.department IN ('design', 'marketing')

-- Checkbox custom field
cf.reviewed = 'true'

-- Null checks on custom fields
cf.priority IS NULL                           -- Not yet prioritized
cf.priority IS NOT NULL AND cf.priority <= 3  -- Low priority tasks
```

### Combined Queries

```sql
-- Urgent todo: due today or tagged urgent, not done
(deadline <= 'today' OR tags = 'urgent') AND status != 'done' AND status != 'archived'

-- Work in progress: in-progress tasks with work tag
tags = 'work' AND status = 'in-progress'

-- Recently active: incomplete tasks updated in the last 7 days
updated_at >= '-7d' AND status IN ('todo', 'in-progress')

-- Needs attention: overdue or due this week, still todo
(deadline < 'today' OR deadline BETWEEN 'today' AND '+7d') AND status = 'todo'

-- High priority engineering tasks
cf.priority > 5 AND cf.department = 'engineering' AND status != 'done'

-- Unplanned urgent tasks
deadline IS NULL AND tags = 'urgent' AND status = 'todo'
```

### With Sorting

```sql
-- Todo tasks, newest first
status = 'todo' ORDER BY created_at DESC

-- Overdue tasks, earliest deadline first
deadline < 'today' AND status != 'done' ORDER BY deadline ASC

-- Recently updated tasks
status != 'archived' ORDER BY updated_at DESC

-- High priority by update time
cf.priority > 5 ORDER BY updated_at DESC

-- All tasks alphabetically
ORDER BY title ASC
```

## Tips and Notes

1. **String values require quotes** — All string values must be enclosed in single quotes (`'todo'`) or double quotes (`"todo"`). Numbers do not need quotes.

2. **Field names are case-sensitive** — Always use lowercase field names: `status`, `deadline`, `created_at`, etc.

3. **Valid status values** — The built-in status values are: `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`, `archived`.

4. **Array field behavior** — The `tags` field is an array. Use `=` to check if it contains a specific tag, `IN` to check for any of several tags, and `CONTAINS_ALL` to require all specified tags.

5. **Custom field prefix** — Always use the `cf.` prefix when querying custom fields: `cf.priority = 5`, not `priority = 5`.

6. **ORDER BY placement** — The `ORDER BY` clause must always be the last part of the query. Place all filter conditions before it.

7. **Default sort direction** — If you omit `ASC` or `DESC`, the default sort direction is `DESC` (descending).

8. **Date format** — The query engine supports ISO 8601 dates (`2024-01-15`), named expressions (`today`, `tomorrow`), and relative expressions (`-7d`, `+1m`). Relative expressions are always quoted: `'-7d'`, not `-7d`.

9. **Sortable fields** — `ORDER BY` only works with: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deadline`, `title`. Other fields cannot be used for sorting.

10. **Empty queries** — You can use `ORDER BY` alone without any filter conditions to sort all tasks: `ORDER BY deadline ASC`.
