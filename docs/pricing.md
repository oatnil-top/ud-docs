## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is UnderControl cloud-hosted?

No. UnderControl is **100% self-hosted**. You run it on your own infrastructure (server, VPS, or local machine). We never host your data.

### Do I need technical knowledge to self-host?

**Personal tier:** No! Our one-line installation script handles everything. If you can copy and paste a command, you can run UnderControl.

**Pro/Max tiers:** Basic computer skills are enough. Advanced features like cloud storage are optional and come with step-by-step guides.

### Can I try Pro features before purchasing?

Yes! The Personal tier includes all core features. You can evaluate UnderControl thoroughly before upgrading. Pro/Max mainly adds multi-user support and storage flexibility.

### What happens if my Pro/Max license expires?

Don't worry - your data is safe! Your UnderControl installation automatically switches back to Personal tier (free version):
- Only one user can access the system (the admin)
- Advanced features like team management become unavailable
- Cloud storage switches to local storage

**Important: Your data is never deleted.** You can renew your license anytime to restore full functionality.

### What cloud storage options are available?

Pro and Max tiers support popular cloud storage providers:
- **AWS S3** - Amazon's cloud storage
- **Cloudflare R2** - Cost-effective alternative to S3
- **MinIO** - Self-hosted option
- **Backblaze B2** - Affordable cloud storage
- **DigitalOcean Spaces** - Simple cloud storage
- **Wasabi** - Hot cloud storage

You can also use local storage (files saved on your server) with any tier.

### Is the license per server or per user?

**One license per installation.** If you install UnderControl on one server, you need one license - no matter how many people use it (up to your license's user limit).

Example: If you have a Pro license for 10 users, all 10 people can use the same installation with one license.

### Can I get a refund?

Yes! We offer a **30-day money-back guarantee**. If UnderControl doesn't work for you, just let us know and we'll refund your purchase - no questions asked.

### How do I purchase a license?

License purchasing will be available soon. For early access or questions, contact us at: support@undercontrol.io
